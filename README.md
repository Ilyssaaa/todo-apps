# This repo Learn JavaScript code for a todo app.

# The app allows users to add, mark as completed, remove, and undo tasks. The app also uses local storage to store the data.


The code uses a custom event called RENDER_EVENT to notify the browser to render the todos. This allows the code to be more modular and reusable.
The code uses the isStorageExist() function to check if the browser supports local storage. This prevents the code from throwing an error if local storage is not supported.
The code uses the console.log() function to log messages to the console. This can be helpful for debugging the code.
